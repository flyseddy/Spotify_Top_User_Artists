# Top Listened to Artists Visualization Program

This a program I made using the Spotify Web API and the Spotipy Library to access the user's top listened to artists and their popularity and create a visualization of it using Plotly.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the following packages for this project. Then follow the code inside the project.

```bash
pip install spotipy
pip install plotly
```
